This repository contains the Angular front-end project of the web-app that supports the 'saveDforest' (v1) game - a browser based, serious game for promoting environmentally sustainable behaviors through empathy. 

While the game itself was built using Unity, the web-app that supports it is based on a MEAN stack.
